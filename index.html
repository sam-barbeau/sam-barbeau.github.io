            <p> <br>
                Sleep is very important, yet many people do not get enough of it. In fact,
                50% of college students report daytime sleepiness, and 70% report insufficient 
                sleep. The GPAs of students receiving 9+ hours of sleep per night were significantly
                higher (3.24) than those of students receiving 6 or fewer hours of sleep per night (2.74).
                One reason for this is because sleep helps us retain memories, refresh our brains, and 
                interact with other people. <br>

            <p><br>
                From athletes and bodybuilders to those simply focusing on good nutritional health, many people track protein consumption.
                According to 
                <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein#:~:text=The%20recommended%20dietary%20allowance%20to,grams%20of%20protein%20per%20day">Mayo Clinic</a>, 
                the recommended amount of daily protein intake to prevent deficiency for an average 
                adult is 0.8 grams per kilogram (~0.3629 grams per pound) of body weight. <br>
                Some of the most healthy types of protein include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Plant sources (lentils, beans, nuts, ect.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lean meats
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seafood
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eggwhites
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the tracker linked in the subtitle 
                to help you track your protein intake throughout the day! Note: if you exercise or if you are above the 
                ages of 40-50 your daily protein needs increase in order to support muscle growth and prevent losing muscle mass.
