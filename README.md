This code focus on two main features: tracking sleep and tracking protein. The Health Center (index.html) is the home page, and users can go to the sleep_tracker and protein_tracker interfaces through links on the home page.

The sleep_tracker tracks sleep throughout week and recommends that users sleep at least 49 hours a week (7 hours a day).

The protein_tracker tracks protein consumption throughout a day and recommends the amount of protein based on the weight (in pounds) of the user.
